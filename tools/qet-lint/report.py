"""Violation type, text/JSON output, and baseline diffing.

The baseline mirrors ``tests/determinism/baseline.json`` in shape -- a map
keyed by file, then by check id, then by a scalar result. Here the scalar is a
violation *count* (a file can carry several duplicate uuids), where the
determinism baseline's scalar is a boolean.

The comparison is the same "got worse" gate the determinism harness uses: a
regression is a (file, rule) whose count went *up* (or is brand new); the
inverse -- a count that went down -- is reported as an improvement, not a
failure, because a legitimate fix is not a regression. The important thing a
suppressing baseline must NOT do is hide a rule silently breaking: if P001
fired N times yesterday and zero today, that shows up as N vanished
violations, not as a green run.
