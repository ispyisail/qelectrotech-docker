"""
Canonical projection of a .qet project file.

Per SIMULATOR-DESIGN.md §4.3, this is the single most important piece of
code in the harness: too strict and every oracle drowns in false
positives from cosmetic noise (colours, fonts, timestamps); too loose and
it hides real corruption. It has its own tests in tests/test_canon.py,
including a test that it DOES detect deliberately corrupted state --
a canon() that can't tell two different projects apart is worse than
useless.

What counts as identity-bearing here, and why:

  - element:    uuid, type, x, y, z, orientation, prefix, freezeLabel.
                NOT colour/font/label-rendering attributes -- those are
                display config, not content.
  - conductor:  QET's schema has no conductor uuid (verified against the
                examples corpus -- <conductor> carries terminal1/terminal2
                but no uuid attribute), so identity is the SORTED
                (terminal1, terminal2) pair within its diagram. Sorted
                because a conductor is electrically symmetric; if a
                resave ever swapped which terminal is "1" and which is
                "2" that would be a cosmetic difference, not a semantic
                one, and should not fail O2/O3.
  - diagram:    QET's schema has no diagram uuid either -- identity is
                the `order` attribute (folios are explicitly ordered;
                see moveDiagramUp/Down in qetdiagrameditor.cpp). Title is
                kept as informational only, since renaming a folio is a
                legitimate edit, not corruption.
  - uuid_universe: EVERY uuid attribute found anywhere in the document,
                tagged by its element name. This is deliberately generic
                rather than hand-enumerating every item type (dynamic
                texts, terminal strips, independent texts, ...) so O3
                (full uuid set preserved) covers item types this module
                was never taught about by name.

Explicitly stripped, never even parsed into canon: the <properties> block
(saveddate*, savedtime, savedfilename, savedfilepath) -- these change on
every save by design and are not content.

# O6: geometric invariants -- independent of canon(), operates directly
# on the file so it can flag literal "nan"/"inf" strings that _num()
# would otherwise swallow as "non-numeric".
#
# NaN/Inf detection is an ABSOLUTE invariant: no real, un-corrupted
# project should ever contain one (verified: zero hits across all 23
# files in qet-fix/examples/).
#
# Grid alignment is deliberately NOT checked as an absolute invariant.
# Measured against the same 23-file corpus, 5 real, ordinary example
# projects contain elements sitting at positions like x="488" or
# x="201" -- not multiples of 10, not of 5, not corrupted, just placed
# there by a user with snapping off (or by an older QET version, or via
# import). An absolute "everything must be on a 10px grid" check would
# have flagged 483 "violations" in one single legitimate file
# (perceuse.qet) alone -- exactly the false-positive flood
# SIMULATOR-DESIGN.md §4.3 warns a too-strict canon() produces.
#
# The property PR #660 actually cares about, and the one worth
# checking, is a DELTA: an element that WAS on the grid before an
# operation must still BE on the grid after it (design doc §3, O6:
# "an item on the grid stays on the grid after any rotate/move/undo
# cycle"). grid_regressions() below checks exactly that, comparing two
# snapshots of the same uuids rather than judging either one in
# isolation.
